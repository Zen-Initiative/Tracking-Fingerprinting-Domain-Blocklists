These domain blocklists are generated using DuckDuckGo Tracker Radar data (categorized trackers):   
[https://github.com/duckduckgo/tracker-radar/blob/main/build-data/static/categorized_trackers.csv](https://github.com/duckduckgo/tracker-radar/blob/main/build-data/static/categorized_trackers.csv)  

Two versions available:  
- ``` Trackers_domain_blocklist.txt``` blocks common domains hosting tracking/fingerprinting/advertising scripts etc.
- ``` Trackers_and_social_media_blocklist.txt``` additionally blocks social media domains (that host both regular content and tracking scripts etc.) and may also break social media share/comment functions on third-party websites
